The [Ketogenic diet] is a low [carb], moderate [protein], and high [fat] diet which
puts the body into a [metabolic state] known as [ketosis]. In this state, the [liver][liver]
[breaks down fat] producing [ketones] which become the main energy source for the body.
Ketogenic diet is based around the premise that our body was designed to run more efficiently
as a fat burner than a sugar burner.

## Why do you get fat?

![How you get fat in 12 sad steps]

When you [eat carbs], the [blood sugar rises], causing hormone [insulin] to be [released].
This hormone commands body cells to either [use glucose], or [store it as fat]. It also
decreases [leptin response] and [prevents fat cells] from being used, leading to more
[hunger after meal]. Regular [high carb consumption] thus means more hunger,
[insulin resistance] and [obesity].

## How does Ketosis work?

![How does Ketosis work]

When you [lower your carb] intake, [blood sugar drops], which in turn [lowers insulin]
levels. This allows fat cells to enter the bloodstream and [head to the liver].
[Satiety] is also increased due to proper leptin response, making you feel full. When
your body is producing [optimal ketone] levels you begin to notice many [health],
[weight loss], physical, and mental [performance][perf] [benefits].

## How can you reach ketosis?

![Easy to avoid]

To reach ketosis, cut out all [sugary], [deep-fried], [processed] foods and initially
limit carbs to 20g daily. The general ratio is 70% fat, 20% protein, and 5% carbohydrates.
Ketones are excreted through urine, so take enough salt and water to keep yourself
hydrated. Consider eating only in an 8hr period ([intermittent fasting]), and add
exercise to your daily routine. [Reduced hunger] and [increased energy] is a sign that
you are [in ketosis].
